Assuming that indexing starts from 1, the errors i have found are

#In line 1, missing a colon(':') after the function definition

#In line 3 and line 4, double equal to sign('==') should be replaced by a single equal to sign('=')

#In line 6, '***' should be replaced with '**'

#In line 10, there should be a comma in between the function parameters as well as a colon(':') after the function declaration
 
#In line 12, there should be a colon after the for loop

#In line 13, is_narcissistic() is not defined and should be replaced with is_narc() and there should be a colong after the if statement

#In line 16,print_narc_numbers() is not defined and should be replaced with print_narcis_numbers()
